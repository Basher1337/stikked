= Installing stikked =

Installing stikked at the moment isn't exactly trivial in future releases there will be a wizard but at the moment here's how it goes.

# Download stikked from http://code.google.com/p/stikked

# Make sure your server supports PHP5 (PHP4 may work but it's not tested) and MySQL.

# First create a user and database for Stikked using a tool like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL Administration CLI.

# Run the following command to setup the database structure;

	mysql -u username -p databasename < mysql.sql
	
You will be prompted for the password enter it, and it'll create the table structure.

# Configure Stikked
	# Open /system/application/config/config.php - and edit the base_url value.
	# Open /system/application/config/database.php - and fill in the relevant information for your database.
	
# You should be up and running now, post any bugs to http://code.google.com/p/stikked/issues .
